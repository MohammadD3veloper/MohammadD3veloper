## About me
Hello visitor!

Im Python programmer and I so love this language it's so helpful & useful for me, IDK about you darling.
Im Django(Python framework) developer, with this is so easy to create many types of website's, you should take everything easy (maybe PHP hates me or upside down)
I have 18 years old with a little school lessons that I'll should learn them and Im a little busy these time's :(. maybe I should say sorry to you guy!
I've worked python for 4 years and django for 2 years. I'm Linux user about 4 years too.

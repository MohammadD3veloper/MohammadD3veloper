Everything you should know about me, is below:

## About me
Hello dear visitor! 👋

thanks for visiting my github page, maybe there is something you should know about me? Actually who am I ?
I have 18 years old with a little school lessons that I should learn them😣 and Im a little busy these time's :(. Maybe I should say sorry for you guy!
I've worked python for 4 years and django for 2 years. I'm a Linux user about 4 years too.😎
I'm a Python programmer🐍 and I ❤️ this language so much. It's so serviceable for me, IDK about you darling🤷.
I'm a Django(Web Python framework)👀 developer, It's so easy to create various types of websites with Django, you should take everything easy 😈(maybe PHP hates me or vice versa)

Perhaps now you know me just with above descriptions.
